# SDG 4 Evaluation and Education Status in Rwanda

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate and analyze the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 in Rwanda, focusing on quality education. We will collect and analyze data on various aspects of the educational system to identify gaps, assess progress, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Data Requirements

### 1. Learners and People with Disabilities
- **Number of Disabled Learners**: Collect data on the number of learners with disabilities in schools.
- **Impact of Infrastructure**: Analyze how the lack of disability infrastructure affects their academic performance and participation.

### 2. Handwashing Facilities
- **Location Type Data**: Gather data on the availability and access to handwashing facilities in schools by location type (urban vs. rural).
- **Improvement in Rural Areas**: Track the progress of handwashing facilities' accessibility in rural areas over recent years.

### 3. Hygiene-Related Diseases
- **Health Data**: Collect statistics on diseases related to poor hygiene in schools to assess the impact of improved handwashing facilities on student health.

### 4. ICT Skills Distribution
- **Gender Distribution**: Obtain data on ICT skill levels distributed by gender to understand disparities and target areas for improvement.

### 5. Literacy and Numeracy Rates by Location
- **Location Type Data**: Compile literacy and numeracy rates differentiated by location type (urban vs. rural) to identify regional disparities and needs.

### 6. Access to Computers by Location
- **Location Type Data**: Collect data on computer access in schools categorized by location type to understand regional disparities in technology access.

### 7. Number of Schools by Location
- **School Distribution**: Gather the number of schools in different locations (urban vs. rural) to analyze the distribution of educational resources.

### 8. Student Performance and Computer Access
- **Performance Data**: Analyze student performance metrics in relation to their access to computers to understand the importance of technology in learning.
